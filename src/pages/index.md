My background has always been in computers and exploring the possibilities they offer. Web Development became my chosen medium due to ease of access and the wealth of knowledge available.

### Education

In 2012 I started my Web Design and Development degree at [Northumbria University](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/) in the beautiful city of Newcastle. This is where I learnt the basics in design, development, marketing, and UX. My degree has taught me considerable amounts about the web industry giving me a solid foundation to start a career as a web designer and developer. The course allowed me to explore areas often alien to developers such as marketing and business development. 

### Experience

 For the last two and a half years I have been a Support Developer at [Amaze](https://www.amaze.com) working on complex CMS and Commerce solutions. Within this role I provide technical support and facilitating feature requests based on the clients needs. In the past I have completed occasional freelance work, this includes taking care of Wynbrook Homes development needs.
